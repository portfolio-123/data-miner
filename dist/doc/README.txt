to implement advanced data mining operations


YAML

Batch Runner operation is defined using files in YAML syntax.
YAML stands for Yet Another Markup Language is is more human readable
than say JSON or XML.

The easiest way to learn YAML is to start from one of the examples we 
provide. It should become very intuitive. Just remember these rules

- YAML is very picky about structure and indentation. Indentation is 
achieved using spaces. The [Tab] character is invalid and it's automatically
replaced by spaces.

- Indentation should be obvious and familiar, like a tree structure or your
file explorer in windows. If something looks unbalanced it's probably wrong.

- List of things, like iterations, are started with a hyphen '-' with the 
appropriate indentation
